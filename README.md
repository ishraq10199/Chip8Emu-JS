# Chip8 Emulator

A simple Chip8 emulator/interpreter written in vanilla JS.

- Runs on the browser, accessible [here](https://ishraq10199.github.io/Chip8Emu-JS)ðŸ‘ˆ
- Debugging UI inspired by [this X post](https://x.com/kraptor/status/1153936421209509888)
- Used Tobias's [excellent Chip8 emulation guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) as reference
- No external dependencies and libraries used

## Motivations

- Wanted to get started with emulator programming somehow, and Chip8 seemed like a good starting point
- Wanted to use barebones HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for something "lower level"
- Got a _little_ bored of CRUD apps ðŸ™ƒ

## Todos

- I might get into Gameboy emulation later, with a different language
- Not very likely, but I could add support for SuperChip and Chip48 with mode switching
